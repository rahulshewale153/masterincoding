package array

/*
	array operation time complexity
	lookup   o(1)  //ex. arrayName[index] arr[3]
	push     o(1)  // put data in last index of array
	insert   o(n)  // put data first index of array and reindexing array
	delete   o(n)  // delete data from given array location and reindexing array

	Two Type of array
	1) Static Array
	2) Dynamic Array

	Dynamic array is good because it size is dynamically and for static array we set fix size.
		ex. we create array with size 5 and we only store 3 element in array. so here occured extra space for staticc array
